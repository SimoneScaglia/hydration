# Hydration

Hydration is a Flutter app (currently in development) that helps users track their daily water intake. Each glass represents 250ml of water, and users can easily add or remove glasses throughout the day. The app also sends notifications if no water has been logged for more than 3 hours.

## Features

- Track daily water consumption by adding or removing 250ml glasses  
- Navigate between days using left and right arrows in the bottom navigation bar  
- Return to the current day using a home icon  
- Receive reminders if no water has been consumed in the past 3 hours
